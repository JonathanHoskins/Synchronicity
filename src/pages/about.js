                            Tucked away in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains lies an old gathering grounds for the Cherokee Tribe. This landscape of fields, forests and streams is rich with a pristine, ancient energy that can be tapped by those with a certain knowledge and ability.
Contact has been made with such individuals--a group of kindred souls, a sort of tribe in its own right, beings who once assembled regularly but have since spread like the winds--through the North, South, East and West--now are re-uniting forces once again to draw upon this energy, sharing it with other similar and like-minded souls...

If you have spent any time frequenting bass music shows in Atlanta then chances are you've heard and are possibly homeys with Ployd aka Bass Jesus aka Trap Jesus aka The Godfather. Although recently named "Atlanta's Best DJ" in Creative Loafing (readers choice), Ployd has been on the grind playing clubs since 06 playing with a slew of the top names in electronica from Rusko, Excision, Reid Speed, Mayhem, and Borgore to Zoogma, Big Gigantic, Papadosio and many many more.
                            Without a doubt he has played a large influential part in the Southeastern scene helping to start Atlanta's first two Dubstep collectives; Atlanta Dubstep and Wobble House. Currently Independent, Ployd bounces from city to city in the southeast heating up dance floors with his versatile and tasteful DJ sets. Coming soon to a club, festival, ballroom, bingo game, or bonfire near you.
